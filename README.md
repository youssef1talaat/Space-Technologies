         the development of the space tech.
      2. First project with space technology on earth
      3. First people and country benefits from it
   E. Rockets and space shuttles.
      1. Rockets and space shuttles help transport people to space 
      2. Satellites, Telescope, and space stations helps people to discover more 
about space.
II. Space technology and how does it benefit the earth.
A.Communication satellites provide access to phone and internet services.
B. Positioning satellites tell us where we are by telling us where they are.
C. Earth observation satellites which tell us what is going on in our 
environment.
D. Role of space technology in space exploration 
E. Space technology and recycling garbage.
1. The use of material recycling as a raw material for rocket construction.
F. Space manufacturing materials hard to of make on earth.
1. The use of [ZBLAN] as an optical fiber used in different application 
like spectroscopy and laser power delivery.
III. Communication technology and movement in space 
A. How do Astronauts communicate with each other?
1. Astronauts communicate with each other using devices in their helmets 
which can transfer the sound waves of their voices into radio waves.
B. How can Astronauts move in space?
1. Astronauts use special types of ropes that can let them move in space 
and to keep them around the space craft if they have any problem.
IV. Satellites
A. What is a satellite?
1. Satellites is like a moon, planet or a machine that orbit the earth. An 
example for that, the earth is a satellite that orbit the sun.
B. What are the benefits of the satellites?
C. Why is satellites important?
1. It allows to see large areas of earth at one time, it is more likely a bird’s 
eye.
2. Satellites can see from space better than a telescope on earth’s surface. 
D. What are the components of the satellite?
1. Satellites comes with a lot of shapes and sizes, but most of them 
have at least two common parts an antenna and a power source.
2. Communications system, which includes the antennas and 
transponders.
3. The power system, which includes the solar panels.
4. the propulsion system, which includes the rockets.
E. How do satellites orbit the earth?
1. Satellites are launched into space on rockets. A satellite orbits the 
earth when its speed is balanced with the earth’s gravity.
F. Types of satellites
1. Communications satellite
2. Direct-broadcast satellite.
3. Earth observation satellite
4. Geosynchronous satellite.
5. Military satellite
6. Reconnaissance satellite.
7. Navigation satellite.
